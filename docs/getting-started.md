# Getting started

## Install

We recommend a fresh Conda environment (use miniconda or miniforge).

```bash
pip install dirigo
```

For development from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dirigo-developers/dirigo
cd dirigo
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart (simulated hardware)

```python
# minimal skeleton â€” adjust to your actual API
import dirigo

def main():
    pass
    # TODO

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

::::{note}
Real hardware examples are provided as tutorials but are **not executed** on Read the Docs.
